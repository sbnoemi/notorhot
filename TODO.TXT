* Package for PyPi
* Add to djangopackages
* Restrict competition generation to require matching categories
* User-suggested options
* Expire competitions after a certain date
* Refactor views to declare model on class so can override with proxies / subclasses easily.  Esp. important for get_absolute_url overrides.
